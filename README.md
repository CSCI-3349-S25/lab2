# Lab 2: nltk and spaCy

---

**First**, clone this repo down to your own machine. [Here's a link to detailed directions for doing this with GitHub Desktop and with git from the command line](https://github.com/CSCI-3349-S25/git-instructions). **Next,** finish reading this README file to complete your environment setup. **Finally,** complete the lab in the Colab notebook, as described below. When you're done you'll download, add, commit, and push your notebook to your repo. You will also share your Colab notebook with me and the TAs.

In this lab, you'll be learning how to use the nltk library to carry out text normalization and do some basic text analysis. At the very end, you'll use a different library, spaCy, which will allow you to do much of this normalization in a more streamlined but less transparent way. 

The lab will be entirely contained within a Colab notebook. If you have never used one before, don't worry! This lab will walk you through using Colab.

Depending on how you installed Python 3.9 and what you have done before, it's possible that you are going to need to install some stuff. Please review the material below.

### Part 1: Getting your own copy of the Colab notebook.



### Part 2: Complete the Colab notebook
* Follow the instructions in the Colab notebook for Lab 2 to create your own copy of the notebook.
* Edit the Colab notebook to complete the various tasks, as indicated in the notebook. Most of the time this will involve writing code in a code cell, but sometimes you will answer questions in a text cell. It will always be clear what you have to do.
* When your notebook is complete, you will share the notebook with me and the TAs, as decribed in the notebook.

### Part 3: Submit your work

* Download your Colab notebook to your computer, move it into this repository, and add, commit, and push it to GitHub, just like you did for Lab 1.
* **Do not alter the Colab notebook after the deadline.** If you do -- even just to fix a typo! -- it will look like you turned the notebook in late.
