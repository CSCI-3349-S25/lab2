If you have trouble with the ``nltk.download()`` code block in the notebook, try this:

1. Launch a terminal and type python3 to get an interactive shell. Alternatively, launch Anaconda, then use the interactive shell.

2. Type

```import nltk```

```nltk.download_shell()```

This will allow you to download packages without the GUI. You should first select `d` for download and then type `popular`.
